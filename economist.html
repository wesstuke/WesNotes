</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #f0f0f0">
<td>4/1/2023</td><td>After the US pulled out of ABM and INF, Russia has now "suspended" New START and deployed tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus.  Seeking to appear responsible, the US will continue to provide day-to-day notifications of movement of weapons and/or tests.</td><td>Global</td><td>Military</td>

<tr style="background-color: #ffffff">
<td>4/1/2023</td><td>Rice production is highly susceptible to climate change (monsoons and drought), and a larger source of greenhouse gases than any food except beef.  Rice is also not particularly nutritious (may contribute to diabetes). Governments should nudge introduction of new technologies for growing and toward corn and bread.</td><td>Global</td><td>Healthcare</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #f0f0f0">
<td>3/25/2023</td><td>Belarus has served as a launching point for Russian troops, missiles, and logistics, but is unlikely to contribute any of its 45K poorly trained troops (Most Belarussians are fond of Ukrainians and only 7% support intervention).</td><td>Europe</td><td>Belarus</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #ffffff">
<td>3/25/2023</td><td>TikTok forced rivals to copy their model: Instagram (Reels), Pinterest (Watch), Snapchat (Spotlight), YouTube (Shorts), and even Netflix (Fast Laughs).  But the new model is less profitable (TikTok makes $67 annually per user while Instagram makes $200).  It's easier to slip ads into news feeds than short-form videos.</td><td>Business &amp; Economics</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #f0f0f0">
<td>3/25/2023</td><td>The Ukrainian army established 60 new attack-drone squadrons, at least one in every brigade, with separate staff and commanders--the first of its kind in the world.  They've begun some strikes deeper into Russia (St. Petersburg), though Russia's use of Iranian strike drones have been more sophisticated.</td><td>Europe</td><td>Ukraine</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #ffffff">
<td>3/18/2023</td><td>Under AUKUS, US will sell up to five Virginia-class subs to Australia in the 2030s, and share technology for Britain and Australia to co-design/builid a next-gen submarine for the 2040s (and the US/UK will deploy subs to Perth).  Worries are overblown over proliferation (nuclear powered, not weapons) and arms race (China already started).</td><td>Asia</td><td>Australia</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #f0f0f0">
<td>3/18/2023</td><td>Western sanctions of ~1,400 Russian oligarchs push them closer to Putin because there is no channel to get off the list.  Smarter sanctions would offer a legal way off by resigning jobs, denouncing the war, or returning funds.</td><td>Europe</td><td>Russia</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #ffffff">
<td>3/18/2023</td><td>Climate hawks and Big Oil both like geothermal energy, in which hot water is pumped from underground reservoirs to create steam, which rotates a turbine. Yet even though America is the world leader in geothermal generation, it accounts for less than 1% of the country’s power production (expensive, permitting problems).</td><td>United States</td><td>Energy</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #f0f0f0">
<td>3/11/2023</td><td>USG thinks Xi ordered PLA to develop the capacity to invade Taiwan by 2027. China would use element of surprise, disguise early moves as exercises, and blanket Taiwan in missiles, opening up a two-day window.  It would then conduct a challenging amphibious assault, transport nearly 1M troops across the strait, and conduct urban warfare in Taipei.  US planners emphasize “distributed lethality” (scattering and constant movement of forces to avoid becoming easy targets).  US ships would hang back, relying on subs and planes.</td><td>Asia</td><td>Taiwan</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #ffffff">
<td>3/11/2023</td><td>Test scores may be correlated with privilege, but they are probably the hardest part of an admissions application to warp with money (studies find tutoring has marginal impact on scores; much easier to buy help on coursework or extracurriculars).  A better way for Ivy Leagues to fix inequality would be to discontinue legacy admissions.</td><td>United States</td><td>Education</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #f0f0f0">
<td>3/11/2023</td><td>Low fertility rates, low immigration, families leaving cities, and pandemic withdrawals mean pupil numbers are falling in American cities.  Budgets will follow, but pathwork school boards and powerful teachers unions will not downsize efficiently.</td><td>United States</td><td>Education</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #ffffff">
<td>3/11/2023</td><td>Cremation is now more common than burials, but six states have legalized body composting, in which the body is broken down by microbes over 3 months alongside woodchips, straw, and alfalfa, which create a warm atmosphere of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and moisture.  It is much greener than burial (steel, concrete, embalming fluids) or cremation (carbon emissions).</td><td>United States</td><td>Other</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #f0f0f0">
<td>3/4/2023</td><td>A new Palestinian group called the Lion's Den has no leadership or affiliation with the government, Hamas, or Fatah.  Amid escalating violence, their platform is simply to resist the occupation.</td><td>Middle East &amp; Africa</td><td>Palestine</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #ffffff">
<td>3/4/2023</td><td>40% of the globe is overweight or obese, costing billions in medical treatment and lost productivity.  Many are in the Third World, caused by genes and a superabundance of cheap convenient processed foods.  A new class of injections called GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce weight by 15%+.  Governments should provide to those who need the most, allowing those seeking cosmetic improvements to pay out of pocket.</td><td>Global</td><td>Healthcare</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #f0f0f0">
<td>2/25/2023</td><td>New Apple and Google privacy protections had cut into Meta, Twitter, and Snap's ad revenues; causing them to introduce paid tiers.  They are fighting back by offering cheaper subscriptions to those who join via the web instead of the app, where apple takes as much as 30%.</td><td>Business &amp; Economics</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #ffffff">
<td>2/25/2023</td><td>Britain revoked citizenship of Shamima Begum, a Londoner who traveled to Syria in 2015 to join ISIS at age 15.  They would do better to bring her home and put her in prison than leave her in a poorly-controlled desert camp.</td><td>Europe</td><td>UK</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #f0f0f0">
<td>2/25/2023</td><td>Despite being unable to feed its people, North Korea helped fund its military by stealing and laundering $1.7B in cryptocurrency in 2022.  Western law enforcement and crypto exchanges are getting better at policing themselves.</td><td>Asia</td><td>North Korea</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #ffffff">
<td>2/18/2023</td><td>International law forbids shooting down objects (e.g. satellites) above the Kármán Line (328,000ft altitude). Slightly below that can be a gray area, but at 60,000ft China’s balloon was clearly too low to be defensible.</td><td>Global</td><td>Military</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #f0f0f0">
<td>2/18/2023</td><td>At least 15 states are proposing laws making it harder to perform in drag. Most restrict hours or limit public funding, but the most extreme could criminalize Harry Styles concerts or historically accurate Shakespeare performances. Republicans are looking for new culture war issues after abortion, and gain more support by focusing on “protecting children” than anti-adult LGBTQ rhetoric.</td><td>United States</td><td>Other</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #ffffff">
<td>2/18/2023</td><td>Following charges for bribery and fraud, Netanyahu has proposed allowing Knesset to limit supreme court jurisdiction, stack justices, and override decisions. This would remove nearly all checks and balances. Israel has no upper house to review legislation or formal constitution, relying instead on a series of “basic laws” passed by the Knesset to be quasi-constitutional.</td><td>Middle East &amp; Africa</td><td>Israel</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #f0f0f0">
<td>2/18/2023</td><td>In 1965, as Britain decolonized the Maldives, it claimed the neighboring Chagos Archipelago and Diego Garcia (on lease to the US military until 2036). Increasing international pressure may convince it to return Chagos to Mauritius, where its original residents were relocated.</td><td>Asia</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #ffffff">
<td>2/11/2023</td><td>With jamming turned off to not disrupt friendly drones and traditional missile interceptors wildly expensive, the best way to attack the enemy's small UAS is with other quadcopters.  Ukrainians are learning to attack from above, since cameras face down and rotors are on top.</td><td>Global</td><td>Military</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #f0f0f0">
<td>2/11/2023</td><td>Russian businesses have diversified supply chains away from the West.  And Russian plutocrats have profited off a Russian decree that exiting businesses must sell assets to the government at 50% discount.  Nonetheless, with oil prices falling and military spending maxed out, health and education spending will bear the brunt of a war with no end in sight.</td><td>Europe</td><td>Russia</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #ffffff">
<td>2/11/2023</td><td>US sanctions traditionally weaponize the ubiquity of the dollar to prevent targets from using it.  However the US is increasingly leveraging the Foreign Direct Product Rule (against Huawei, Russian Military, Chinese advanced semiconductors), which attempts to weaponise the ubiquity of American technology. It lets the government claim jurisdiction over almost every chip factory in the world, because almost every one contains hard-to-replace American tools.</td><td>United States</td><td>Business &amp; Economics</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #f0f0f0">
<td>2/11/2023</td><td>Florida effectively banned Critical Race Theory and AP African American studies.  Meanwhile, the California university system requires applicants to submit a DEI statement which can be used as an ideological litmus test.  America needs institutions that let students examine contradictory arguments, have debates, and choose based on merits--not monocultural incubators of mutually exclusive ideologies. </td><td>United States</td><td>Education</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #ffffff">
<td>2/4/2023</td><td>Bats (the only flying mammal) account for 90% of viral transmission (often to a "bridge" animal and then humans).  Habitat loss is pushing them closer to humans and climate change is weakening their diets, increasing the risk of new diseases.  </td><td>Science &amp; Technology</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #f0f0f0">
<td>2/4/2023</td><td>South Korea, the world's 8th largest arms exporter is skirting a law against providing lethal aid by selling weapons to countries giving their arms to Ukraine.</td><td>Asia</td><td>South Korea</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #ffffff">
<td>2/4/2023</td><td>As much as $100B was stolen from COVID relief programs--particularly antiquated state Unemployment Insurance programs and small business loans distributed through the Paycheck Protection Program.</td><td>United States</td><td>Economy</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #f0f0f0">
<td>2/4/2023</td><td>5-10% of police officers account for all excessive force complaints.  Holding them accountable is difficult.  Punishing officers call into question hundreds of previous arrests, negative publicity, and potential lawsuits. Good officers rarely whistleblow on their own, instead avoiding bad pockets (e.g. Scorpion Unit).</td><td>United States</td><td>Policing</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #ffffff">
<td>1/28/2023</td><td>Stress does reduce performance in athletics.  Using heartbeat (measured by flushing of skin) as a proxy for stress, researchers found that every extra bpm decreased an archer's score at the 2020 Olympics by 0.004 points.</td><td>Global</td><td>Sports</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #f0f0f0">
<td>1/28/2023</td><td>In the past 20 years, France's obesity rate doubled to 17%.  It is still well behind America (40%), Mexico (33%) or Britain (26%).</td><td>Global</td><td>Healthcare</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #ffffff">
<td>1/28/2023</td><td>After the Great Recession, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley successfully diversified away from investment banking, which now combines the drawbacks of a regulated activity (capital requirements and red tape) with the vices of a speculative one (volatility and huge payouts to executives).  Goldman Sachs, however, abandoned its plan to build a consumer bank, posted its worst returns in a decade, and a subsidiary pled guilty for bribes related to 1MDB.  The real action in finance is outside regulated banking, where a new cohort of stars rules, including Blackstone in private markets and BlackRock in index funds.</td><td>United States</td><td>Business &amp; Economics</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #f0f0f0">
<td>1/21/2023</td><td>The 1987 Montreal Protocol succeeded in banning 99% of ozone-damaing chlorofluorocarbons (used in refridgeration and hairspray).  While increasing CO2 and methane levels are still causing global warming, the earth's ozone-layer should recover to 1980 levels around 2050.</td><td>Global</td><td>Climate</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #ffffff">
<td>1/21/2023</td><td>A Chinese company affiliated with Huawei is building a spaceport in Djibouti, which is close to the equator (giving rockets extra boost) and has a large sea port (although a long way from China).  China is looking to grow a space industry to rival the US.</td><td>Asia</td><td>China</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #f0f0f0">
<td>1/21/2023</td><td>Corporeal punishment (beatings) in school is still legal in 19 states, mostly those with an evangelical protestant pedigree. Of 69,000 instances in 2018, 30% were in Mississippi.  Students can be put on a "no-paddle list" if they "bruise easily," but many parents forget or don't know.</td><td>United States</td><td>Education</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #ffffff">
<td>1/21/2023</td><td>Despite unprecedented spending as a percent of GDP, global healthcare is severely challenged.  Populations are aging.  Staffing shortages increase wages which drive up cost.  COVID lockdowns left people sicker as they cancelled preventative visits.  Burnt out staff and COVID protocols (e.g. extra cleaning) sap productivity.</td><td>Global</td><td>Healthcare</td>

<tr style="background-color: #f0f0f0">
<td>1/14/2023</td><td>Russia is not only creating fake videos (e.g. Zelensky telling his troops to surrender), but exploiting the fact it is difficult to prove real videos are authentic. Apps (eyeWitness, ProofMode, Truepic) are working on "glass-to-glass" technology.  They record time/location based on GPS and a unique hash value for the footage and sends to a special server of original content; or use other methods of authentication.</td><td>Science &amp; Technology</td><td>&nbsp;</td>

<tr style="background-color: #ffffff">
<td>1/14/2023</td><td>1-in-20 partnered people are in a consensual non-monagamous relationship while 1-in-5 have tried it at some point.  Polyamorous people now seek tax, healthcare, and immigration benefits conferred to monogamous marriages.</td><td>United States</td><td>Other</td>

<tr style="background-color: #f0f0f0">
<td>1/7/2023</td><td>SpaceX has launched 3,500 Starlink satellites with plans for up to 40,000.

<td>12/24/2022</td><td>Major League Cricket (MLC) will begin in 2023 with pro-teams in Dallas, LA, NYC, SF, Seattle, and DC (plus 26 farm teams).  The first cricket match was in Manhattan, but baseball dominated behind the (artificial) story of Abner Doubleday during the Civil War.  Nonetheless, cricket is ripe for renaissance in the largest global sports market, with baseball's popularity waning, a more diverse population, wealthy Indian-Americans investing in stadiums, and World Cup hosting duties in 2024.</td><td>United States</td><td>Sports</td>

<tr style="background-color: #f0f0f0">
<td>12/24/2022</td><td>Whereas Rennaissance Europe favored radial cities (easiest to defend), American cities are famous for their grids, which are efficient to overlay public transit/sewage and simple to navigate.
